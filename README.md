# LetsMeet

This is a project developed under NUS Orbital 24/25.

LetsMeet is an app created with the goal of giving busy students a more efficient way of collaborating with other students, providing convenient schedule management, task tracking, as well as an algorithm to match available timeslots with other users.

For testing, you may refer to our vercel deployment https://letsmeet-orbital-discode.vercel.app/. Thank you.
